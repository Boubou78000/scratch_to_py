# scratch_to_py

This is a tool that converts Scratch source code to Python code. 🤩
It's forked (copied) from *boubou78000/scratch_to_blocks*, originally from @Brianyu28 's repository.
It's goal 🥅 is to do a *zero-shot* python scratch code ✨ (that means you don't need to learn how to use it to understand the code 😁).
OKAY I THINK IT WILL BE CANCELLED 😨
